<h2>PAMMY AND THE HOFFS</h2>

<p>We needed a site for our very part time band.<br> Using the design pallets that we already had, and a style that's been lingering around for a while I saw it as a good opportunity to put together a rather more ostentacious frontend.</p>

<p>The site itself is fairly basic. I used create-react-app as a boiler plate, and tried to use functional components where ever possible</p>

<p>I used this site as a change to really experiment and improve my knowledge of react transitions using react-transition-groups. This was a real learning curve, but I'm happy with the way the animations worked out. Although some are a little over the top, they were fun to put together and I can use the knowledge to make simpler animations in future.</p>

<p>
For the first time as well I really looks at how the site would look on mobile, but for different devices. The 3 row layout for the homepage wasn't really for mobile, so I used another layout that was specifically for mobile to help with the UX.
